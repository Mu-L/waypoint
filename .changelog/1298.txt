```release-note:feature
**Mutable Deployments**: Waypoint now supports the concept of "mutable" deployments
where a deployment updates an existing resource rather than creating something
new. New plugins in this release include deploying from a Nomad job file,
Kubernetes apply from a directory or file, and more.
