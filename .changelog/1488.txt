```release-note:feature
**Status Reports**: Waypoint now supports a new feature for reporting 
on the health of deployments or releases. Waypoint surfaces a deployment 
and or releases status by relying on an existing platform for health checks.
A status is responsible for reporting the health of a deployed service by
representing its states as Ready, Alive, Partial, Down, or Unknown.
Platform health reporting lets teams take action quickly depending on the health
of their applications. Currently, the Kubernetes, Nomad, AWS ALB, and Docker built-in
plugins support the new Status reporting, with more support on the way!
